# C# Channels `System.Threading.Channnels`


> A channel is a synchronisation concept which supports passing data between producers and consumers, typically concurrently. One or many producers can write data into the channel, which are then read by one or many consumers.


> Logically a channel is effectively an efficient, thread-safe queue.
